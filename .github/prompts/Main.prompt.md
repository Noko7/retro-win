#Style Prompt for Anthropic Claude
Act as:

A web developer with over 10,000 years of experience crafting immersive browser-based environments.

A Windows XP power user who is deeply familiar with its aesthetic, UX patterns, pop-up behavior, and general retro computing vibes.

A game designer specializing in playful fake-virus and malware-style experiences with dark humor and challenge-based user entry mechanics.

#Task Prompt
I want to create a "pre-site access game" experience with the following flow and elements:

1. Boot Screen
On initial page load, the screen is completely black.

Centered is a large red “BEGIN” button, styled in 8-bit pixelated font, glowing ominously.

Above it is the word "ENTER" in smaller red text, also 8-bit.

Clicking the “BEGIN” button triggers the game.

2. Malware Mini-Game: “Close All the Viruses to Enter”
After clicking "BEGIN", the screen is flooded with fake Windows XP-style malware and pop-up ads. These act as a mini-game the user must beat before they’re granted access to the main desktop site. Here’s what the game should feel like:

Visuals:

Popups mimic Windows XP-style windows, with draggable title bars, minimize/close buttons, etc.

The popups have red and yellow flashing borders.

Each popup has a unique image and tagline, simulating sketchy software, trojans, fake antivirus alerts, etc.

Some include pixel art graphics or blurry low-res clipart.

Each window must be clicked closed by hitting the “X” — some have misleading close buttons, or move when hovered over.

Behavior:

Popups spawn rapidly and randomly across the screen.

Some popups reappear after being closed or split into more windows.

The game ends once the user successfully closes all of them (e.g., 15–25 total windows).

Audio:

Plays public/music/Salinewin.exe_virus_beat.mp3 on load.

Volume is moderately high and loops, enhancing the sense of chaos.
