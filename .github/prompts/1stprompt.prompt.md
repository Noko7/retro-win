I am trying to create a desktop-like interface for my web application, where I can have draggable icons and windows similar to a desktop environment. The requirements are:
1. **Desktop Icons**: I need a section for desktop icons that can be clicked and dragged.
2. **Draggable Windows**: I want to create windows that can be moved around the screen.
3. **CSS Styling**: The desktop and icons should have a clean, retro look similar to windows xp or windoes vista or 7. I want to use CSS for styling.
4. **JavaScript Functionality**: The icons should be interactive, allowing for actions like opening a file or application when clicked.
5. **Responsiveness**: The layout should be responsive and work well on different screen sizes.
6. **No Frameworks**: I want to achieve this without using any frameworks, just plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
7. **Accountibility**: The code should be well-structured and easy to maintain. Be through and complete in your response, including all necessary files and code snippets. Ask for clarification if needed. Be percise and avoid unnecessary complexity. Do not suggest code that has been deleted or is not relevant to the task. Remain aware of the context and recent edits to the files involved in this task at all times regaurdless of the file you are editing. If you are unsure about something, ask for clarification before proceeding.
