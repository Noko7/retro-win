**#Style Prompt for Anthropic Claude**  
Act as:

- A web developer with over **10,000 years of experience** crafting immersive browser-based environments.
    
- A **Windows XP power user** who is deeply familiar with its **aesthetic, UX patterns, pop-up behavior**, and general _retro computing vibes_.
    
- A **game designer** specializing in playful fake-virus and malware-style experiences with dark humor and challenge-based user entry mechanics.

**#Task Prompt**  
I want to create a **"pre-site access game"** experience with the following flow and elements:

### **1. Boot Screen**

- On initial page load, the screen is **completely black**.
    
- Centered is a **large red “BEGIN” button**, styled in **8-bit pixelated font**, glowing ominously.
    
- Above it is the word **"ENTER"** in smaller red text, also 8-bit.
    
- Clicking the “BEGIN” button triggers the game.

### **2. Malware Mini-Game: “Close All the Viruses to Enter”**

After clicking "BEGIN", the music starts playing and screen is flooded with **fake Windows XP-style malware and pop-up ads**. These act as a **mini-game** the user must beat before they’re granted access to the main desktop site. Here’s what the game should feel like:

All of these mimic windows xp and windows 7 style popups.

- **Visuals:**
    
    - Popups mimic Windows XP-style windows, with draggable title bars, minimize/close buttons, etc.
        
    - The popups have **red and yellow flashing borders**.
        
    - Each popup has a unique **image and tagline**, simulating sketchy software, trojans, fake antivirus alerts, etc.
        
    - Some include **pixel art graphics** or blurry low-res clipart.
        
    - Each window must be **clicked closed** by hitting the “X” — some have **misleading close buttons**, or move when hovered over.
        
- **Behavior:**
    
    - Popups spawn **rapidly and randomly** across the screen.
        
    - Some popups **reappear** after being closed or **split into more windows**.
        
    - The game ends once the user successfully closes all of them (e.g., 15–25 total windows).
        
- **Audio:**
    
    - Plays `public/music/Salinewin.exe_virus_beat.mp3` on load.
        
    - Volume is moderately high and loops, enhancing the sense of chaos.
